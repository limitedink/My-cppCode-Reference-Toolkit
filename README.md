# My-cppCode-Reference-Toolkit
My personal C++ code reference and toolkit - a collection of useful code snippets and tools for my own reference. This repository serves as a backup for quick access to common coding techniques in C++, with my personal notes providing additional context. Not for widespread distribution, but feel free to use it for your own learning and reference.
